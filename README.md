## About me
My name is Ewelina Stańczak. For the last 7 years I have been working as a Chemical Technologist. In my job, I wrote a lot of research reports. I often created tables and charts in Excel. My duties also included analyzing the amount of raw materials and reporting the need to order new ones, as well as analyzing the amount of products in stock and creating cards for the necessary quantities. I really like work related to data analysis, so I create my own projects. 

## My documentations
My portfolio is related to my interests, daily life problems and other considerations.
